# cpp-reflect

Language-level reflection for C++ has a long and uncertain road ahead of it, and it appears less and less work being put into it ([https://lists.isocpp.org/sg7/]).

This project was an effort to provide build tooling for embedding Clang AST information about source code into the built binary, and then provide APIs for accessing the AST information from within that program at runtime.

## Status

Partial proof of concept functional, abandoned.
